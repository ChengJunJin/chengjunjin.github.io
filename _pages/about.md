## About Me

I am **ChengJun Jin**, a researcher with a strong passion for **AI-driven networking** and **distributed systems**. Currently, I am conducting research on **CDN pricing strategies** at Korea University, exploring cost structures, pricing models, and their impact on network efficiency. My goal is to optimize CDN pricing frameworks to enhance cost-effectiveness and service quality.

Previously, I worked at **Beijing CSII Software Co., Ltd.**, where I was involved in the **GOLDILOCKS distributed database** system, focusing on database optimization and performance tuning.

Beyond research, I have hands-on experience in **full-stack development**, including **e-commerce automation** and **database management**. My projects range from **CDN pricing surveys** to **machine learning-driven data processing**. I am always open to collaborations in AI, networking, and large-scale distributed systems.

Feel free to explore my **[CV](cv/)** and **[projects](projects/)** to learn more about my work!
